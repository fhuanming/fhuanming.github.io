*A distribution or withdrawal of Roth 401(k) is usually taxable unless the inital contribution was made more than 5 years ago and you're at least 59.5. Early withdrawels maybe subject to 10% federal penalty tax.

**Pre-tax and Roth commbined cannot exceed the amount listed.

# IRA

## Types of Contributions

|  | Traditional IRA | Roth IRA |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Income Limits | No | Phase-out starts at \$122000, ineligible at \$137000 if single. Phase-out starts at \$193000, ineligible at \$203000 if married. |
| Contribution Limits(2019) | \$6000(<50),\$7000(>50)* | \$6000(<50),\$7000(>50)* |
| Tax Deduction | No deduction if your income is above certain amount.** | No |
| Withdrawal | Withdrawals are penalty free beginning at age 59.5. | Contributions can be withdrawn at any time, tax-free and penalty free. Five years after your first contribution and age 59.5, earnings withdrawals are tax-free, too. |

*This covers your total contribution to either a Traditional or a Roth IRA.

**This means the Trditional IRA can contain after-tax contributions. When you take a distribution from a nondeductible contribution, the portion of the distribution coming from nondeductible contributions is tax-free. For example, if two-thirds of your traditional IRA's value comes from nondeductible contributions, two-thirds of your distribution will be tax-free.

Roth IRAs:
Contribution Dealine: 04/18/Y for Year Y-1

## Pro-rata Rule

Calculate how much money in your Traditional IRA accounts is pre-tax and how much is after tax. Treat all of your IRAs like one big IRA for this purpose. Say you have a total of \$100,000 in all of your accounts, and \$10,000 of it is money you put in after taxes. You will owe taxes on 90% of the money you convert to a Roth.
