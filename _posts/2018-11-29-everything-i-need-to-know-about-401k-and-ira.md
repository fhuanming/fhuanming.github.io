# 401(k)

## Types of Contributions

|  | Pre-tax 401(k) | Roth 401(k) | After-tax 401(k) |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|
| Contribution Taxed today? | No | Yes | Yes |
| Contribution Taxed upon withdrawal? | Yes | No | No |
| Earning taxed upon withdrawal? | Yes | No (for qualified withdrawals)* | Yes |
| Can you convert to Roth later? | Yes | No | Yes |
| Contribution Limits (2019) | $19000(<50), $25000(>50)** | $19000(<50), $25000(>50)** | $27500 |

*A distribution or withdrawal of Roth 401(k) is usually taxable unless the inital contribution was made more than 5 years ago and you're at least 59.5. Early withdrawels maybe subject to 10% federal penalty tax.

**Pre-tax and Roth commbined cannot exceed the amount listed.

# IRA

## Types of Contributions

|  | Traditional IRA | Roth IRA |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Income Limits | No | Phase-out starts at $122000, ineligible at $137000 if single. Phase-out starts at $193000, ineligible at $203000 if married. |
| Contribution Limits(2019) | $6000(<50), $7000(>50)* | $6000(<50),$7000(>50)* |
| Tax Deduction | No deduction if your income is above certain amount.** | No |
| Withdrawal | Withdrawals are penalty free beginning at age 59.5. | Contributions can be withdrawn at any time, tax-free and penalty free. Five years after your first contribution and age 59.5, earnings withdrawals are tax-free, too. |

*This covers your total contribution to either a Traditional or a Roth IRA.

**This means the Trditional IRA can contain after-tax contributions. When you take a distribution from a nondeductible contribution, the portion of the distribution coming from nondeductible contributions is tax-free. For example, if two-thirds of your traditional IRA's value comes from nondeductible contributions, two-thirds of your distribution will be tax-free.

## Pro-rata Rule

### What is this

The pro-rata rule is the formula used to determine how much of a distribution is taxable when the account owner holds both after-tax and pre-tax dollars in their Traditional IRA(s).

Calculate how much money in your Traditional IRA(s) accounts is pre-tax and how much is after tax. Treat all of your IRAs like one big IRA for this purpose. Say you have a total of $100,000 in all of your accounts, and $10,000 of it is money you put in after taxes. You will owe taxes on 90% of the money you convert to a Roth.

### How to avoid it

You can roll the pre-tax amounts from your Traditional IRA(s) to 401(k). And then roll the after tax amounts from your Traditional IRA(s) to Roth IRA.

# Backdoors and Rollover

## Backdoor Roth IRA

In a short: Convert from Traditional IRA to Roth IRA.

1. Ensure you don't have any amount of pre-tax IRA(s).

    This is to avoid Pro-rata rule.

1. Make a non-deductable IRA contribution.

    This is as known as after-tax traditional IRA.

1. Convert the money from traditional IRA to Roth IRA.

## MEGA Backdoor Roth IRA

In a short: Convert from after-tax 401(k) to Roth IRA

1. Contribute to your after-tax 401(k).
1. Convert that money to the Roth IRA.

    Ideally, you can convert the money to Roth IRA as soon as you cotribute the money to the after-tax 401(k). In this way, you don't need to pay the earning tax because this is no earning yet (in your after-tax 401(k) account).
