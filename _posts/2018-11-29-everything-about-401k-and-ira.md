*A distribution or withdrawal of Roth 401(k) is usually taxable unless the inital contribution was made more than 5 years ago and you're at least 59.5. Early withdrawels maybe subject to 10% federal penalty tax.

**Pre-tax and Roth commbined cannot exceed the amount listed.

In a short, don't withdrawal your money from 401(k) or IRA before you're 59.5, unless you have no choice.
